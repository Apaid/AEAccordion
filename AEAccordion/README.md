**iOS tableView with accordion effect (expand / collapse cells) + XIB in XIB solution**

> I had 2 interesting problems today:  
1. Create UITableView with accordion effect (expand / collapse cells)  
2. Use XIB files inside other XIB files (example: using custom views from XIB inside custom UITableViewCell, also from XIB)  
At the end I wanted to share my solution. You can see it in action below, and for details refer to the code, it's very light.
